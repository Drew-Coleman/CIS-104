print("drew 3/20/23 At what size of a project should you start using version management software? Version management software is useful for any size of software development project, from small personal projects to large-scale enterprise projects. Even for small projects, using version management software can provide benefits such as maintaining a record of changes made to the code, allowing developers to revert to earlier versions if necessary, and enabling collaboration with other developers. For larger projects with multiple developers, version management software becomes essential for managing changes to the codebase and ensuring that everyone is working with the most up-to-date version of the code. In short, it is recommended to use version management software from the very beginning of any software development project, regardless of its size.")
